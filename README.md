# Nikon-Ekrynox-SDK
This C++/C# library provides an alternative method for controlling Nikon Cameras on Windows.  
It is not specific to a model and tries to be as general as possible.  
It can connect to multiple cameras of the same models and different models.  

The two sample programs are not complete and are for testing purposes.  
You can find a great application of the C# Interface, here: [NEK as N.I.N.A plugin](https://github.com/Ekrynox/Nikon-Ekrynox-SDK-for-NINA)  
C++ Interface is pretty similar.
